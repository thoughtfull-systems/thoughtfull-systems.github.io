Hi!  I'm technosophist.  I'm having fun discovering how things work and why they're here.  I like nerd culture and the intersection between creativity and technology.  I write primarily in two modes:

[Topics]({{< ref "topics" >}}) is like a wiki, long-form articles organized by topic and cross-linked.

[Notes](/notes/) is like a blog, short-form, essays on a variety of topics ordered chronologically.
